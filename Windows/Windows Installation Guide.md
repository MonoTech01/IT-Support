# ðŸ’¾ Windows Installation Guide
## ðŸ“Œ Preparation
- A **USB flash drive** is required for this setup.
- Two installation methods are covered in this guide:
  - **Method 1 (USB Flash Drive):** Easier and recommended for most users, as Microsoft provides an automated setup process.
  - **Method 2 (ISO File):** Ideal for advanced users or those installing via DVD.
- If you have a USB, stick with **Method 1** since Microsoftâ€™s tool will set up Windows automatically, eliminating the need for third-party tools like Rufus.
- If you are using a **DVD** :dvd:, select **Method 2**â€”no need for Rufus.
- For Linux installation, simply mount the **ISO file** in your VM. Refer to my **Ubuntu installation guide** in the Linux repository for more details.

## ðŸ’­ My Thoughts - From My Experience!
- **Windows 11 vs. Windows 10:** Although many people dislike Windows 11, I recommend upgrading since **Windows 10 support will end in October 2025** (no more security updates or Microsoft support).
- **Personal Experience:** After upgrading my **Surface Pro 7** to Windows 11, I initially experienced freezing and performance issues. However, after continuous updates, the system has improved, and I decided to stick with Windows 11.
- **Upgrade Process:** Upgrading from Windows 10 to 11 is **extremely easy**â€”just click **"Download and Install"** in Windows Update. If you donâ€™t like Windows 11, Microsoft allows you to **roll back to Windows 10 within 10 days** by clicking a simple button.
- **Why This Guide?** I created this guide after being tasked at work with upgrading a **Windows 7 machine to Windows 10**. Fortunately, my coworkers provided a **USB with a Windows 10 ISO file**, but if you donâ€™t have access to a pre-made USB, youâ€™ll need to create one yourselfâ€”**this guide will walk you through the process!**
- **Letâ€™s do this! ðŸš€** If you're ready to upgrade, follow the steps and enjoy a smooth installation process!

## Step 3: Upgrade Win 10 in a computer
1. Restart and Enter Setup:
   
Restart your computer.

During startup, press the key to enter BIOS/UEFI setup (often Delete, F2, F12, or Esc). Look for a message on the boot screen indicating the key.

3. Boot from USB Drive:

In BIOS/UEFI setup, change the boot order to prioritize your USB flash drive.

3. Install Windows 10:

Follow the on-screen prompts to choose language, time zone, and keyboard settings.

Enter your product key.

Choose "Custom" installation for a clean install. Delete all partitions except for "Drive 0 Unallocated Space" and format the drive if needed.

The installation process will begin.

4. Set Up Your PC

# Method 2: Using ISO file, but putting the file in a USB instead of a DVD :dvd: by using Rufus.

What is ISO file? An ISO file is a digital archive/copy of a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray disc = contents inside a CD, DVD, Blu-ray disc. It's a single file that stores everything on the disc, making it handy for things like installing programs or backing up data.

# Step 1
- Download and install Rufus. Rufus is a tool used to create bootable USB drives easily.

# Step 2
- Download the media creation tool. Choose option "ISO file" instead of USB flash drive

- When you see the "Burn the ISO file to a DVD", just press "finish" because we will put the file in the USB. No need to choose "Open DVD burner".
