## 🔍 **Paper Jams Troubleshooting**
### **Step 1: Identify the Jam Location**
- Check the printer’s **control panel** for error messages.
- Review the paper path diagram to determine the jam location.

### **Step 2: Clear the Paper Jam**
- **Remove the paper tray** and inspect the entry point.
- If paper is visible, pull it out **slowly and evenly** to avoid ripping.
- If the jam is deep inside the machine, remove necessary components:
  - **Laser Printers**: Remove the **toner cartridge and drum**.
  - **Multifunction Devices**: Check for multiple jammed pages.

### **Step 3: Ensure No Debris Remains**
- Check the entire paper path for any torn paper pieces.
- Remove any **dust, debris, or stuck sensors** that might still register a jam.
- Power cycle the printer and check if the issue persists.
