# Note
- A empty USB is needed for this setup!
- 2 methods will be mentioned in this guideline. The first one (USB flash drive) is easier than the second one (ISO file). However, both of them are easy to perform!

# My thoughts - From my experiences!
- Although I know that a lot of people do not like Win 11, I encourage you to use Win 11 because Win 10 will be no longer supported by Microsoft in October 2025. This means there will not have security updates or technical supports for Win 10 from Microsoft.
- My Surface Pro 7 sometimes started freezing and running slow after upgrading to Windows 11...Then, I contacted Microsoft supporters to ask about this issue and wanted to downgrade from Win 11 to 10. However, when I know about the end of life of Win 10, I changed my mind. I decided to stick with Win 11 and have continued updating features and fixes of Win 11. Hopefully, Win 11 will get better over time.
- All my devices are using Win 11, I do not have any problems of using VM or anything else so far! Upgrading from Win 10 to 11 is extremely easy, all you need is just click "Download and Install" option in Win updates. If you do not like Win 11, you have an option to go back Win 10 effortlessly supported by Microsoft within 10 days of the upgrade. This means another button must be clicked and there you go!
- Why do I tell you that story? Because I want you to know that the new technology supports you to update or upgrade Win easily....However, It will be a different story to upgrade from Win 7 to Win 10. That is why we need this guideline! Let's gooooooooooo!
- I had an idea to do this instruction due to a task in my work. I was asked to upgrade from Win 7 to Win 10. Luckily, my coworkers gave me a usb having Win 10 ISO inside. But, what if, you do not have nice coworkers like mine, what will you do? You need to do it from scratch! No worries, we will have some fun from here! Let's goooooooo again :smiley:

# Method 1: USB Flash Drive 
## Step 1:

## Step 3: Upgrade Win 10 in a computer
1. Restart and Enter Setup:
   
Restart your computer.

During startup, press the key to enter BIOS/UEFI setup (often Delete, F2, F12, or Esc). Look for a message on the boot screen indicating the key.

3. Boot from USB Drive:

In BIOS/UEFI setup, change the boot order to prioritize your USB flash drive.

3. Install Windows 10:

Follow the on-screen prompts to choose language, time zone, and keyboard settings.

Enter your product key.

Choose "Custom" installation for a clean install. Delete all partitions except for "Drive 0 Unallocated Space" and format the drive if needed.

The installation process will begin.

4. Set Up Your PC

# Method 2: Using ISO file, but putting the file in usb instead of a DVD by using Rufus.

What is ISO file? An ISO file is a digital archive/copy of a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray disc. It's a single file that stores everything on the disc, making it handy for things like installing programs or backing up data.

# Step 1
- Download and install Rufus. Rufus is a tool used to create bootable USB drives easily.

# Step 2
- Download the media creation tool. Choose option "ISO file".

# Step 3

Select the file in Rufus. Then, choose your preferable options and "Start" the process. Make sure that your usb is empty or Rufus will delete all your data in there anyways.

# Step 4
After finishing step 3, you should check your usb, the result should be the same as method 1. 

# Step 5
Repeat Step 3 and Step 4 in method 1.
