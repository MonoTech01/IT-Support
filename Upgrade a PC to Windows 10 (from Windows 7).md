# Notes
- A USB is needed for this setup!

# My thoughts - From my experiences!
- Although I know that a lot of people do not like Win 11, I encourage you to use Win 11 because Win 10 will be no longer supported by Microsoft in October 2025. This means there will not have security updates or technical supports for Win 10 from Microsoft.
- My Surface Pro 7 sometimes started freezing and running slow after upgrading to Windows 11...Then, I contacted Microsoft supporters to ask about this issue and wanted to downgrade from Win 11 to 10. However, when I know about the end of life of Win 10, I changed my mind. I decided to stick with Win 11 and have continued updating features and fixes of Win 11. Hopefully, Win 11 will get better over time.
- All my devices are using Win 11, I do not have any problems of using VM or anything else so far! Upgrading from Win 10 to 11 is extremely easy, all you need is just click "Download and Install" option in Win updates. If you do not like Win 10, you have an option to go back Win 10 effortlessly supported by Microsoft. This means another button must be clicked and there you go!
- Why do I tell you that story? Because I want you to know that the new technology supports you to update or upgrade easily....However, It will be a different story to upgrade from Win 7 to Win 10 => We need this guideline!
